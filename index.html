       <p>Why the in the hell  am I in a racing suit? I'm participating in the <strong>24 Hours of Lemons Car Race</strong> this weekend at the Joliet Autobahn Country Club race track. Me and my fellow <a href="http://boost4.org/" target="_blank">Boost4</a> team members are doing this race to raise money for the <strong>Adian's Army Memorial Foundation</strong>. A foundation which is dedicated to advancing the research and treatment of childhood cancers like Medulloblastoma � the kind of brain tumor 3-year-old Aidan Manning lost his battle with.</p>
       <h1 style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:24px;">But I need your help!</h1>
       <p>Time is running short for us to get as many donations as we can for our charity, <a href="http://boost4.org/" target="_blank">Boost4!</a> - <strong>Any amount helps!</strong></p>
       <a href="http://boost4.org/make-a-donation/" target="_blank"><img src="images/donate-button.jpg" border="0" /></a>
        <p>I'm normally not the one to ask for money, but this is a damn good cause. And I wouldn't be sending this to you if I didn't think it wouldn't matter...but it does. <strong>If not today, then think about it tomorrow...</strong></p>

        <p>Although Aidan Manning did not get the chance to live a long life, his courage, bravery and strength continue to inspire us everyday. Aidan�s Army is dedicated to advancing research and treatment of childhood medulloblastoma, while providing children with the most sophisticated treatments available.</p>
        <p><strong>100% of the donations the Boost4 team receives through this effort will go to Aidan�s Army memorial foundation - Plain and Simple.</strong></p>
